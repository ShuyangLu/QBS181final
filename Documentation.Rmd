# **Data Acquisition**

### 1. New York City COVID-19 Data Archive

+ Source: [\textcolor{blue}{NYC OpenData}](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/COVID-19-Daily-Counts-of-Cases-Hospitalizations-an/rc75-m7u3)

+ Acquisation Method
  + Download .csv file
  
+ Purpose:

  + We will use this time series data to track changes in the incidence of COVID-19.

### 2. New York City Weather Data

+ Source:
[\textcolor{blue}{Weather Underground - Weather Archive}](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ny/new-york-city/KLGA)

+ Acquisition Method

  + Webscraping/ API Tool

+ Purpose:

  + Merge time series weather data with timeseries Covid-19 data and investigate potential associations
  
### 3. Daily UV Index Scores - New York City

+ Source:
[\textcolor{blue}{Central New York's Live Weather Source}](http://www.cnyweather.com/wxuvdetail.php?r=wxuvdetail.php)

+ Acquisition Method

  + UV index values are presented as tables (see figure)
  
  + Copy tables and paste into Microsoft Excel
  
  + Save as .csv file

+ Purpose

  + Sunlight and Vitamin-D absorbtion

    + It is generally accepted that there is a positive association between exposure to sunlight and absorbtion of vitamin-D. 
  
    + It is also generally accepted that there is a positive association between vitamin-D absorbtion and immune system capacity.
  
  + We will us UV-Index as a proxy for exposure to sunlight at the population level and test for associations between UV Index and the incidence of Covid-19.

# Data Cleaning

### **1. New York City COVID-19 Data Archive**

A. Read in the Covid-19 Date Frame

```{r}
covid_df <- read.csv("data/Raw Data/nyc_covid19_data/NYC_Covid_Data_raw.csv")
```

### **2. New York City Weather Data**

A. Read-in File from Raw Data File

  + The raw file has an issue with the column headers.
  
    + Several Headers include symbols that don't work with the interpretor
    
        + eg. $Low\_Temp\textcolor{red}{(^{o}F)},\ High\_Temp\textcolor{red}{(^{o}F)}$
  
  + \textcolor{green}{Solution:} Update column names while reading in the file!

```{r}
#vector with acceptable column names
headers <- c("High.Temp", "Low.Temp", "Avg.Temp", "Precip",
             "Dew.Point", "Humidity", "Date", "City")

#read in the raw data file
weather.raw <- read.csv(file = "data/Raw Data/nyc_weather_raw.csv",
                        header = TRUE, 
                        col.names = headers) 
```

B. Format all observations of the "Date" Variable

+ Variable is of class "character" by default

```{r}
class(weather.raw$Date)
```

+ Reclassify the variable as a "Date"

```{r}
weather.clean <- weather.raw %>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date, "%m/%d/%Y"))
```

+ Outcome:
```{r}
class(weather.clean$Date)
```

C. Missing Data

+ Since we intend to do a time series, we need to identify any missing dates in the "date" column.

  + We will do this using a \textcolor{red}{CUSTOM FUNCTION!}

```{r}
#Custom function to find the missing date in the date column
find.missing.dates <- function(d) {
  date_range <- seq(min(d), max(d), by = 1) 
  date_range[!date_range %in% d] 
}
```

+ Use the custom function to identify missing dates in our NYC Weather df

```{r}
# Display the missing dates
date.missing = c()
date.missing<-find.missing.dates(weather.clean$Date)
print(date.missing)
```

D. Replace Missing Values 

+ Method: Fill the missing data by averaging the former 6 days' data

```{r}
#Find the index of the day before "2020-11-08"
weather.clean$Date<- as.character(weather.clean$Date)
id.missing.date = which(weather.clean$Date == "2020-11-07")+1
```

+ Build a \textcolor{red}{custom function} to fill the missing data

  + Approach: use the average of the previous six days
  
```{r}
# Custom function to fill the missing data by averaging the former 6 days' data
fill.missing.values <- function(df,newrow.id){
  newrow <- list()
  value <- c()
  first.row=newrow.id-6 
  last.row=newrow.id-1
  col.num=ncol(df)-2
  for (i in 1:col.num){
    subs<-weather.clean[first.row:last.row,i] # Create a new subset for each column
    value<-mean(subs) # Calculate the mean
    newrow<-append(newrow,value)
  }
  return(newrow)
}
```

+ Use the custom function to fill in the values of the missing row

```{r}
# Fill the missing values in the missing row
missing.row <- fill.missing.values(weather.clean,id.missing.date)
missing.row <-append(missing.row,"2020-11-08")
missing.row <-append(missing.row,"new york city")
```

+ Build another \textcolor{red}{custom function} to insert the row into the df
```{r}
# Custom function to insert the new row
insertRow <- function(existingDF, newrow, r) {
  existingDF[seq(r+1,nrow(existingDF)+1),] <- existingDF[seq(r,nrow(existingDF)),]
  existingDF[r,] <- newrow
  existingDF
}
```

+ Insert the imputed value into the df!

```{r}
# Insert the missing row and store it into a new df
weather.clean <-insertRow(weather.clean,
                             missing.row,
                             id.missing.date)
```

E. Remove the "City" Variable

  + Every observation is is "new york city"
  
    + This variable is effectively just clutter.

```{r}
weather.clean = weather.raw %>%
  select(-City)
```

F. Display
```{r}
kable(x = weather.clean[1:5,],digits = 2,align = "c")
```

G. Write the Processed Data to a new .csv file
```{r, eval=FALSE}
write.csv(x = weather.clean,
          file = "data/Processed Data/nyc_weather.csv")
```

H. In Excel - Add a "Season" variable to the .csv generated in the prior section

+ Open File in Microsoft Excel

  + \textcolor{red}{Summarise the process}
  
+ Save the file as "nyc_clean_weather_add_season.csv"

  + Push to Github

I. Read in "nyc_clean_weather_add_season.csv" and reformat the "date" variable

+ Read in the file
```{r}
#vector with acceptable column names
headers <- c("High.Temp", "Low.Temp", "Avg.Temp", "Precip",
             "Dew.Point", "Humidity", "date", "City",
             "Month", "season")
add_season_nyc_weather <- read.csv(file = "data/nyc_clean_weather_add_season.csv", 
                                   header = T, 
                                   col.names = headers) %>%
  select(-City)
```

+ Reformat the "date" variable
```{r}
# change date type from ymd to mdy
add_season_nyc_weather$date <-format(as.Date(add_season_nyc_weather$date, '%Y/%m/%d'), "%m/%d/%Y")
```

J. Display

```{r}
knitr::kable(x = add_season_nyc_weather[1:5,],align = "c")
```

### **3. Daily UV Index Scores - New York City**

A. Read in the csv file that we built in excel

```{r}
nyc.uv = read.csv(file = "data/Raw Data/nyc_uv_raw.csv", header = T)
```

B. Remove the "City" Variable

+ Every observation is "New York City" so this variable is effectively clutter. 

```{r}
nyc.uv <- nyc.uv %>%
  select(-City)
```

C. Display

```{r}
knitr::kable(x = nyc.uv[1:5,], align = "c")
```

# Data Wrangling and Objectives

### 1. Is there a Difference in Number of Cases Observed in the Summer vs in the Winter?

A. Add the "CASE_COUNT_7DAY_AVG" variable from the covid df to the add_season_nyc_weather df

+ Visual Aid

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", out.height="100%", fig.cap="CASE_COUNT_7DAY_AVG variable from the covid df to the add_season_nyc_weather df"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/weather_and_7day_avg.png")
```

+ Combine
```{r}
add_season_test <- add_season_nyc_weather
rownames(covid_df) <- covid_df$DATE_OF_INTEREST
add_season_test$Case_Count_7Day_Avg <- covid_df[,"CASE_COUNT_7DAY_AVG"]
```

B. Create a df with ONLY the summer and winter observations

```{r}
sum_win <- add_season_test %>%
  filter(season == "summer" | season == "winter")
```

C. Run a Wilcox Test to test the difference in incidence (summer vs winter)

```{r}
wilcox.test(sum_win[which(sum_win$season=="summer"),]$Case_Count_7Day_Avg,sum_win[which(sum_win$season=="winter"),]$Case_Count_7Day_Avg)
```

+ We can reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in incidence.

### Is there an Association between temperature and Incidence?

+ Scatter Plot
```{r}
ggplot(data = add_season_test) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Avg.Temp,
                           y = Case_Count_7Day_Avg,
                           color = season)
             ) +
  labs(x = "Daily Average Temperature",
       y = "Case Count (7-Day Average)",
       title = "Temperature vs Incidence of COVID-19",
       subtitle = "Stratified by Season") +
  theme_bw() + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = Avg.Temp,
                            y = Case_Count_7Day_Avg),
              method = "lm",
              inherits.aes = F)
```

+ Boxplot

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))  # divide graph area in 2 columns
boxplot(add_season_test$Avg.Temp,main="Temperature")
boxplot(add_season_test$Case_Count_7Day_Avg,main="COVID cases")
```

+ Bar Graph

```{r}
ggplot(data = add_season_test) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Avg.Temp,
                         y = Case_Count_7Day_Avg,
                         fill = season),
           width = 1.5)
```

+ Correlation between Temperature and Case Count

```{r}
cor(add_season_test$Avg.Temp, add_season_test$Case_Count_7Day_Avg)
```

+ Single Variable Linear Regression Model Temperature ~ Cases

```{r}
linearMod <- lm(add_season_test$Avg.Temp ~ add_season_test$Case_Count_7Day_Avg, data=add_season_test)  # build linear regression model on full data
print(linearMod)
```

  + View Linear Model Coefficients
```{r}
summary(linearMod)$coefficients
```

+ Improve Linear Model By using the Log incident case values

```{r}
# log cases
add_season_test$log_cases <- log(add_season_test$Case_Count_7Day_Avg)
for (i in 1:nrow(add_season_test)){
  if(add_season_test$Case_Count_7Day_Avg[i]==0){
    add_season_test$log_cases[i] = 0
  }
}
```

+ Scatter plot of temp~ new log cases 
```{r}
## test log cases
ggplot(data = add_season_test) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Avg.Temp, 
                           y = log_cases,
                           color = season,
                           shape = season)) +
  labs(x="Humidity_index", 
       y ="Log Number of COVID Cases",
       title="Temperature VS Log COVID-19 Incidence",
       subtitle = "Stratified by Season") +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = Avg.Temp,
                            y = log_cases),
              method = "lm",
