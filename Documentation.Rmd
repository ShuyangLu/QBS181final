+ Purpose:

  + We will use this time series data to track changes in the incidence of COVID-19.

### 2. New York City Weather Data

+ Source:
[Weather Underground - Weather Archive](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ny/new-york-city/KLGA)

+ Acquisition Method

  + Webscraping/ API Tool

+ Purpose:

  + Save as .csv file

+ Purpose

  + Sunlight and Vitamin-D absorbtion

    + It is generally accepted that there is a positive association between exposure to sunlight and absorbtion of vitamin-D. 
  
    + It is also generally accepted that there is a positive association between vitamin-D absorbtion and immune system capacity.
  
  + We will us UV-Index as a proxy for exposure to sunlight at the population level and test for associations between UV Index and the incidence of Covid-19.
